# Neovim config
Trying out Neovim as an IDE for some time. Source controlling my config here.

The starting point was the great [kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim) repo.

## TODO
- Consider using [autopairs](https://github.com/windwp/nvim-autopairs) or mini-pairs (probably better)
- I'm loading both everforest and gruvbox everytime, I might be able to only load everforest when it's needed
