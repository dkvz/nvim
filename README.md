# Neovim config
Trying out Neovim as an IDE for some time. Source controlling my config here.

The starting point was the great [kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim) repo.

## TODO
- Consider using [autopairs](https://github.com/windwp/nvim-autopairs) or mini-pairs (probably better)
- I use CamelCase for lua function names sometimes, other times not. I think people use underscores. Maybe?
